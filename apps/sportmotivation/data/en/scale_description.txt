Motivation is understood as the internal tension that drives a person to act. Sports motivation is a widely researched topic both nationally and internationally. One of the most commonly used questionnaires for assessing athletes’ sports motivation is the Sports Motivation Scale. Our motivation can arise from both internal and external sources: we may be driven by the awareness of improvement, the love of movement, or even the presence of a coach; as well as by the possibility of success or the desire to avoid failure during training sessions and competitions. Everyone is motivated in different ways, and there is no single “correct” form of motivation. However, the more diverse the sources of motivation we can draw on to achieve our goals, the more likely we are to persist on the path to success. Therefore, it is beneficial to have both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation available to us.

Intrinsic Motivation – Knowledge Acquisition
This is the motivation toward growth, exploration, curiosity, learning goals, and the fundamental desire to understand and master new skills.
Athletes may experience intrinsic learning motivation when they want to acquire new movement forms or training methods.

Intrinsic Motivation – Striving for Perfection
This is the motivation toward performance and achievement, with a focus on task orientation.
It drives individuals to reach a certain result or create something meaningful.

Intrinsic Motivation – Enjoyment and Experience
This is the motivation to seek pleasure and experiences.
Athletes with this motivation compete to experience the excitement and thrill of the sport.

Introjected Regulation
The goal here is to enhance self-esteem or avoid feelings of shame.
When an external motivational factor becomes internalized, it no longer needs to be present to drive behavior.
Athletes with high levels of this motivation are often driven by guilt or worry after poor performance, and may feel discomfort if they are out of shape.

Extrinsic Motivation – Identification
In this case, the athlete evaluates the sports activity as important but is driven primarily by external factors (e.g., material rewards, success, parental expectations, or the desire to satisfy the coach).
Athletes with high scores in this dimension are more strongly influenced by praise or potential rewards.
Those with lower scores are less affected by such external factors.

Amotivation – Perceived Difficulties
This represents the presence of difficulties perceived as overwhelming during sports performance and the lack of goal achievement.
Athletes in this state may feel that their abilities are insufficient and that they have no control over improving the situation.
Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are typically low in such cases.
